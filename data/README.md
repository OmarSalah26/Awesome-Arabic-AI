# Data and Evaluation for Arabic AI

High-performing models depend on high-quality data. This section tracks the most important corpora, benchmarks, and leaderboards that drive Arabic AI research forward.

## 📚 Key Corpora

| Corpus | Type | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ArabicWeb16** | Web Crawl | High coverage of Egyptian, Gulf, and Maghrebi dialects. |
| **OSCAR** | Multilingual | Language-classified Common Crawl data. |
| **Common Voice** | Speech | Community-driven audio recordings and transcriptions. |
| **Shami Corpus** | Dialect | Natural conversations for Levantine adaptation. |

## 🏁 Native Benchmarking

Research is shifting from **translated benchmarks** (which suffer from cultural misalignment) to **native benchmarks** created in Arabic.

- **ArabicMMLU**: Native school exams.
- **ArabLegalEval**: Specialized legal knowledge.
- **AraTrust**: Safety and hallucination checks.
